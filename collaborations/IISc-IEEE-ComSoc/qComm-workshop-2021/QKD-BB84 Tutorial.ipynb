    "\n",
    "<b>\"Key distribution\"</b> is a type of secure communication protocol which is accomplished with the use of a <b>\"key\"</b> (which is just a bitstring with a sequence of 0s and 1s) that is uniquely known only by the sender (let's call them \"Alice\") and receiver (let's call them \"Bob\"), and enables them to encrypt and decrypt a sent message. If a key can be securely distributed between Alice and Bob, the encrypted message can be securely sent over a public channel. Without this key, it is difficult to sucessfully decrypt this message by an eavesdropper. Thus, a secure communication relies on the ability of Alice to encrypt the message in a way that only Bob can decrypt it. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>\"Quantum key distribution\"</b> or <b>\"QKD\"</b> is unique compared to classical key distribution schemes because it makes use of an important aspect of quantum mechanics where any measurement performed on a quantum system (by any third party, in this case an eavesdropper) disturbs it, thus detecting eavesdropping attempts and securing the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be using <b>Qiskit</b> code to implement <b>BB84 protocol</b> which is a very popular quantum key distribution scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about BB84 and QKD from their [chapter in the Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-key-distribution.html) [1].\n",

    "    2.<b> SELECT MEASUREMENT</b>: Bob randomly selects a basis ( × or + ) to measure each bit.<br>\n",
    "    3.<b> ENCODING</b>: Alice creates the quantum states encoded in the selected bases.<br>\n",
    "    4.<b> SENDING</b>: Alice sends Bob the encoded states via the quantum channel.<br>\n",
    "    5.<b> MEASUREMENT</b>: Bob measures the quantum states in his pre-selected measurement bases.<br>\n",
    "    6.<b> SEND BASES</b>: Alice send which basis were used to encode each bit via the classical channel.<br>\n",
    "    7.<b> FIND SYMMETRIC KEY</b>: Alice and Bob discard bits in their key that used a different encoding and decoding basis.<br>\n",
